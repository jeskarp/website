      <description>I am a researcher in outbreak response analytics, with a background in biostatistics, population genetics, and R programming. I currently work as a lecturer in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. My research focusses on developing new methodologies and tools for understanding how infectious diseases spread, and how we can control them.
Outbreak response analytics I am using the term outbreak response analytics to refer to a holistic approach to outbreak data analysis.</description>
