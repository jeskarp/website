I am a researcher in <em>outbreak response analytics</em>, with a background in
<em>biostatistics</em>, <em>population genetics</em>, and <em>R
programming</em>. I currently work as a lecturer in the 
[Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology/) at 
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My research focusses on
developing new methodologies and tools for understanding how infectious diseases
spread, and how we can control them.



### Outbreak response analytics

I am using the term <em>outbreak response analytics</em> to refer to a holistic
approach to outbreak data analysis. Rather than focussing solely on infectious
disease modelling techniques, I like to emphasise other aspects of epidemics
analysis, which are underestimated at times. This includes not glamorous but
rather essential data cleaning (with reproducible, transparent, auditable
approaches), advanced <em>data visualisation</em> tools including interactive graphics,
and various quantitative approaches for data analysis including
<em>frequentist/Bayesian/non-parametric statistics</em>,
<em>exploratory/factorial/clustering methods</em>, <em>graph theory</em>, with
some increasing interest in <em>machine learning</em> techniques.




### RECON: the R Epidemics Consortium

In September 2016, I have create the <em>R Epidemics Consortium</em>
([https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org)),
an international network of experts in infectious disease modelling, public
health, and software development interesting in developing the next generation
of tools for disease outbreak analysis using the [R software](https://www.r-project.org/).




### RECON learn

In December 2017, I have created [RECON learn](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/)
a platform for sharing free, open training material for epidemics analysis. This
includes a collection of lectures, practicals and case studies, most of which
are distributed under [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).




### Statistical genetics

My earlier research was mostly dedicated to developing multivariate approaches
(factorial methods, clustering algorithms), for exploring genetic data. I am
still involved in some of these aspects. I am the author of 
[adegenet](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/), a 
[popular](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/) R package for genetic/genomic data analysis. 
With [Zhian Kamvar](https://plantpathology.unl.edu/zhian-n-kamvar), I am also running a course on 
[data science for population genetic](https://www.prstatistics.com/course/reproducible-data-science-for-population-genetics-rdpg01/) 
with [PR statistics](https://www.prstatistics.com/).
